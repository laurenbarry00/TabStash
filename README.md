# TabStash
 `git stash`, but for Chrome tabs.

## About
TabStash is a Chrome extension intended for saving currently open Chrome tabs to be opened later. Inspired by the functionality of `git`'s `stash` command.

**Why not just enable the "Continue where you left off" setting in Chrome?**

I don't actually want my tabs to be saved *every* time. 90% of the time, I like my homepage to be displayed when I open Chrome. Occasionally though, I want to be able to re-visit the tabs I had opened before, without having to open up my browser history.
